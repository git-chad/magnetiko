# Shader Studio — Cursor Rules

## Required Reading (every session)
1. Read `MISTAKES.md` — check Quick Rules and recent log entries
2. Read `PLAN.md` — find the next unchecked `[ ]` task to work on

## After completing a task
- Mark it `[x]` in PLAN.md
- If you hit a bug or wrong approach, log it in MISTAKES.md using the template

## After hitting a bug
- Log it in MISTAKES.md IMMEDIATELY, before moving on
- Extract a one-line Rule and add it to the Quick Rules section

## Stack
Next.js App Router, Zustand (immer), Tailwind, Radix, Phosphor Icons, Three.js WebGPU + TSL, GSAP, @dnd-kit

## Non-negotiable
- Shader layers are FILTERS by default, not masks
- Use Three.js TSL for shaders, never raw WGSL
- Follow design system tokens exactly (Appendix A in PLAN.md)
- Test in browser after every subtask — no console errors
